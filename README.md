# Medibox Simulation for ESP32

## ü©∫ Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive simulation of a **Medibox** implemented on the **ESP32 microcontroller** using the **Wokwi** platform within **VS Code** via **PlatformIO**. It was developed for **EN2853: Embedded Systems and Applications** (Assignments 1 and 2) at the University of Moratuwa.

The Medibox assists users in managing their medication schedules effectively by providing timely reminders and maintaining optimal storage conditions for light- and temperature-sensitive medicines.

## ‚ú® Features

### üß™ Assignment 1: Core Medibox Functionality

1. **Menu Interface**  
   - Set Time Zone (with UTC offset)  
   - Set and delete up to two alarms  
   - View active alarms  

2. **Time Synchronization**  
   - Syncs with NTP server over Wi-Fi  
   - Displays current time on OLED  

3. **Alarm System**  
   - Triggers alarms using LED, buzzer, and OLED  
   - Supports stop/snooze (5 minutes) via push button  

4. **Environmental Monitoring**  
   - Reads temperature and humidity via DHT11/DHT22  
   - Issues warnings if values exceed healthy limits:  
     - Temperature: 24‚Äì32¬∞C  
     - Humidity: 65‚Äì80%

### üåü Assignment 2: Enhanced Features

1. **Light Intensity Monitoring**  
   - LDR measures light every \( t_s \) seconds (default: 5s)  
   - Averages readings over \( t_u \) (default: 2 mins)  
   - Normalized (0‚Äì1) average sent via MQTT to Node-RED  

2. **Node-RED Dashboard**  
   - Displays current and historical light intensity  
   - Sliders for:  
     - Sampling Interval \( t_s \)  
     - Sending Interval \( t_u \)  
     - Minimum servo angle \( \theta_{\text{offset}} \)  
     - Controlling factor \( \gamma \)  
     - Ideal storage temperature \( T_{\text{med}} \)  

3. **Servo-Controlled Shaded Window**  
   - Controls exposure via motorized servo window  
   - Computes angle \( \theta \) with the formula:
     \[
     \theta = \theta_{\text{offset}} + (180 - \theta_{\text{offset}}) \cdot I \cdot \gamma \cdot \ln\left(\frac{t_s}{t_u}\right) \cdot \frac{T}{T_{\text{med}}}
     \]

4. **Temperature Integration**  
   - Real-time ambient temperature (DHT11) used in servo equation
