# Medibox Simulation for ESP32

## ðŸ©º Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive simulation of a **Medibox** implemented on the **ESP32 microcontroller** using the **Wokwi** platform within **VS Code** via **PlatformIO**. It was developed for **EN2853: Embedded Systems and Applications** (Assignments 1 and 2) at the University of Moratuwa.

The Medibox assists users in managing their medication schedules effectively by providing timely reminders and maintaining optimal storage conditions for light- and temperature-sensitive medicines.
